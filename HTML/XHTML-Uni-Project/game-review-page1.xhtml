          <p><b>The Review:</b></p>
          <p>
            <b>BEAR SIMULATOR</b> is a game as much as it is a simulator,
            based on the elements of sattire throughout it fits more into
            a playful type of genre than actually being a realistic representation
            of what it is like to be a bear. Looking at this from the angle of a game
            rather than a simulator makes it more enjoyable and playable.
          One of the key elements that stuck out to me from the start were the graphics, although representitive of a subtle bear like environment, in this instance some sort of wildlife enclosure they were not on form with more modern like blockbuster PC games, my graphics card did not struggle and in some places the textures on certain elements of the environment were stretched and badly done, warped in a sense. </p>
          <div class="gamerevimg"><a href="img/bearsim02.jpg"><img src="img/bearsim02.jpg" alt="Bear Sim Img 02"/></a></div>
          <p>At the beginning of the game you wake up in some sort of cave, I immediatly became frustrated, the badly applied textures and lighting in the game gave me a struggle to find my way out of this cave, eventually I seen some badly applied lighting in this instance an exit and made my way forth but not before noticing a grub first and eating it to that of which I seemed to earn points but not deritive to any explanation.</p>
          <div class="gamerevimg"><a href="img/bearsim03.jpg"><img src="img/bearsim03.jpg" alt="Bear Sim Img 03"/></a></div>
          <p>Once outside of the cave the landscape seemed quite plain at this point, I wondered around aimlessly eventually coming across the only amazing visual effect of the entire game, it was glowing flying dust or seeds of some sort that glistened in the bad lighting.</p>
          <div class="gamerevimg"><a href="img/bearsim04.jpg"><img src="img/bearsim04.jpg" alt="Bear Sim Img 04"/></a></div>
          <p>I then carried on my aimless wondering coming across a pond duck I tried to sneak upon it at this point realsing the game had a bad sneaking and hiding system in place because the duck easily just instantly jumped up and flew away, this was the most exciting point in the game.</p>
          <div class="gamerevimg"><a href="img/bearsim05.jpg"><img src="img/bearsim05.jpg" alt="Bear Sim Img 05"/></a></div>
          <p>At this point I thought maybe I need to find food soon in the game (Which at this point objectives, points and survival were still not clear to me within the game.) so I headed over to what seemed like a lake of some sort in the distance, amazing that I then found a lake and the game informed me that I had discovered a new area with no reward, no food, nothing.</p>
          <div class="gamerevimg"><a href="img/bearsim06.jpg"><img src="img/bearsim06.jpg" alt="Bear Sim Img 06"/></a></div>
          <p>I then at this point decided to see if the bear could swim, amazingly the bear could but again with no reward, you would think you would be able to find some food in a lake such as fish or something aquatic but no, nothing.</p>
          <div class="gamerevimg"><a href="img/bearsim07.jpg"><img src="img/bearsim07.jpg" alt="Bear Sim Img 07"/></a></div>
          <p>I then wandered and wandered around this seamingless and boring landscape coming across a hut that humans seemed to have previously been in and I finally found some food, which was a pizza, I also came across a marking on the wall to that of which belonged to a pig however the game indicated that I required the ability 'smell' with no idea on how to gain such ability and the game in its entirety being bland and seamingless I got fed up and gave up at this point.</p>
          
          <p>This games biggest letdown is the lack of things to do and its slightly bad graphics. I also found the very bad interface and lack of any beginning tutorial a massive let down in the game as I just could not figure out what I was doing, in respect of this looking for food anxiously not knowing what you are doing is the life of a bear? Perhaps in that respect it could be deemed as a realistic simulation of a bear, if not then I would just class it as a bad game overall.</p>
