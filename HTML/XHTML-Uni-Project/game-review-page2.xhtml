          <p><b>The Review:</b></p>
          <p>
            <b>Rust</b> is a multiplayer game where you wake up in a field naked, with only a rock and a flame torch, your goal is to survive throughout the environment, build, flourish and defend yourself against other players. From the onset you feel immense fear from all of what you are up against, it can be difficult to plan what to do at first in this respect because are just naked and almost defenceless with only a rock at hand to defend yourself it can be improbable to go up against the other players in the game unless you outsmart them which was the most enticing element for me about this game, it is hard to find and build up resources to defend yourself so you often resort to trickery in order to gain the upper hand.
          </p>
          
          <p>The game is set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland which you discover through old landmarks and indication of radiation in certain places. Perhaps the game could of been made more interesting in respect of law and history or maybe that would take away to much the excellent elements of gameplay.</p>
          <div class="gamerevimg"><a href="img/rust02.jpg"><img src="img/rust02.jpg" alt="Rust Img 02"/></a></div>
          <p>After waking up I walked towards the sea, I noticed a few bases scattered around which already had me in fear so I had my rock at the ready to try and defend myself.</p>
          <div class="gamerevimg"><a href="img/rust03.jpg"><img src="img/rust03.jpg" alt="Rust Img 03"/></a></div>
          
          <p>I went over to a base to find someone already dead on the ground in front of it, it would seem as though there base got raided whilst they were asleep because a player came out in full armor and with a gun but left me alone as soon as I put my rock away and indicated I meant no harm, this was the first instance in a game I can say I used something other violence to defend myself successfully furthermore I was surprised that it even worked and the person did not attack me in the slightest.</p>
          <div class="gamerevimg"><a href="img/rust04.jpg"><img src="img/rust04.jpg" alt="Rust Img 04"/></a></div>
          <p>To the side of this base I noticed a very badly drawn sign indicating to take what I needed, there was nothing in there really of much use though just some blueprints to build stuff which is useless when you have no resources to build anything.</p>
          <div class="gamerevimg"><a href="img/rust05.jpg"><img src="img/rust05.jpg" alt="Rust Img 05"/></a></div>
          
          <p>At this point I was in my inventory screen, the first thing I noticed was that I was a female avatar, according the developer behind rust apparantly they randomly assign you a permenant gender and race at random in the game so people can recognise you by what you look like and not just by your name, they tried a different take on character creation and I thought it was quite an interesting and unique aspect to the game, as for the inventory it was simple enough to use and clearly laid out but not much in mine at this point in my playthrough.</p>
          <div class="gamerevimg"><a href="img/rust06.jpg"><img src="img/rust06.jpg" alt="Rust Img 06"/></a></div>
          <p>After coming out of my inventory screen I noticed the sun had started to set, one thing about this game is the amazing graphics so I took some time to wonder back to the sea front and take in the beautiful view and sunset somehow forgetting that this entire place was dangerous.</p>
          <div class="gamerevimg"><a href="img/rust07.jpg"><img src="img/rust07.jpg" alt="Rust Img 07"/></a></div>
          <p>It was hard to see in the dark at this point and I became scared so I got my torch out and lit it, it did not improve my vision by much though, I had to focus more on sound than anything which the game does a good job of showing, I could hear someone creeping up on me from some direction, they came as if out of nowhere, luckily they were friendly, either that or people at this point just kept noticing I was naked and presumed I had nothing of value.</p>
          
          <p>This game is a very fun and unique experience, the sound and graphics are excellent and I think the thing that sticks out to me the most whilst I played this game was that it was hard to predict what was going to happen next, the developer does a good job of portraying an almost alternate reality experience and not just a game as such in this respect, then there are stuff which I did not have time to look into like base building, modding, custom weapons, clothes and much more, overall it is an excellent in depth game that I could spend a lot of hours playing, an excellent well put together game overall.</p>
