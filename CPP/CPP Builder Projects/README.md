#I am no longer developing using the IDE CPP Builder, these projects however have not been released / built using the runtimes, so the .exe's will not work most likely unless you have an installation of CPP Builder instaled. You can again compile if you have CPP builder to make the .exe's work correctly, overall I have left these projects on here as examples of my CPP code.
